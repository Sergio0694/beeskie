# Beeskie - Privacy Policy 

## Information sent to Bluesky

Beeskie is a third-party client for Bluesky. As such, this app interacts with the APIs provided by Bluesky. For example, in order for Beeskie to display your timeline, we use your provided credentials to talk to Bluesky and retrieve your timeline. When you make a new post or if you `like` something, we send that data to Bluesky via their API. 

Your data is not used in any other way, other than to accomplish operations and interactions with Bluesky.

## How We Collect and Use Other Information 

### Telemetry 
Beeskie collects anonymous, aggregate telemetry. You can view Beeskie's open source repository on GitHub to see all the areas where the app tracks telemetry.

Telemetry is used to understand what parts of Beeskie is being used or not used to help guide future work. This data is not used for marketing or sales. This data is not sent to any third party other than the telemetry service itself.
